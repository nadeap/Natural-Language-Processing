His English teacher says that he is a good pupil, which Lucas knows means that she thinks he is a good student.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas likes art. It is his favorite class.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis third class is science. This class is very hard for Lucas to figure out, but he gets to work with his classmates a lot, which he likes to do. His friend, Kyle, works with Lucas in science class, and they have fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Lucas gets his break for lunch. He sits with Kyle while he eats. The principal, or the headmaster as some call him, likes to walk around and talk to students during lunch to check that they are all behaving.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next class is mathematics, which most of the students just call math.
